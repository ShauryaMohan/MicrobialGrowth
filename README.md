# MicrobialGrowth
This project has two microbes, microbe blue and microbe red. They both have the same strategy, find the closest food and move towards it. But we can change their attributes, like vision (how far they can see the food), initial population, health, speed.  
I have used this to evaluate that which attribute dominates others in two situations, scarce food distribution or abundant food distribution. This is a very simple model but can be very intuitive to understand why some feature was more successful in a given situation.  
## How to run
A simple python simulator.py will run this file, as the only requirement is matplotlib which is usually downlaoded along python. To change values of different features of different type of microbe you may use AgentType.py in which you can change the parameters.
